This is our team's repo! :)

Billiam has some static files ported over from his sandbox. Helpers are:
- `node server billiamServer.js` for a static server to the `public` directory
- `npm run build-css` builds scss into css (config dir in `package.json`)
- `npm run watch-css` constantly watches and compiles
