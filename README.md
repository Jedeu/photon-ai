This is our team's repo! :)

**git convention**
- `staging` for combining feature branches
- `development` as a pseudo-master
- `master` as production

Billiam has some static files ported over from his sandbox. Helpers are:
- `node billiamServer.js` for a static server to the `public` directory
- `npm run build-css` builds scss into css (config dir in `package.json`)
- `npm run watch-css` constantly watches and compiles

Current frontend features are:
- modular js
- eventbus pubsub
- swipe module
